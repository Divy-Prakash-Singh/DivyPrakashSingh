## About Me
I’m a web developer who likes building things that actually solve problems.  
I care a lot about clean code, simple design, and systems that scale well.

I’ve mostly worked on full-stack web applications, and right now I’m getting into **AI Engineering**, especially how AI models are deployed and used in real products—not just experiments.

Things I enjoy working on:
- Full-stack web applications
- Clean and usable UI
- Backend APIs and databases
- Open-source and collaborative projects
